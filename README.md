TorusLight
============

This is the Torus Code. It produces models for orbits in action-angle
coordinates in axisymmetric potentials. Look at the README file. Read
the paper. Try the executables. Look at the doxygen
documentation (start at index.html). Have fun!

This is the light version. It has a less restrictive license, and is missing
the GalaxyPotential code (for realistic gravitational potentials and the ability
to save tori.
